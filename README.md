TODO: Write a better README!

This project is a "player" for subtitles.

Media players play media files, sometimes together with subtitles. This project, however plays just the subtitles, without any other media.

Current state: quick proof-of-concept after a couple of hours of coding.

TODO:

* Read subtitles from `<input type="file">`.
* Make it more accessible by adding `aria` attributes.
* Add keyboard shortcuts.
* Better handling and rendering of the text. Might require a better parser.
    * Multiple lines?
    * Font styling?
* Make the UI easier to use or more intuitive. Or just a better README (and a link to it).
